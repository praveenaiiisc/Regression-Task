# Regression-Task
* Q1:  Multilinear Regression - You need to find the position of a particle in 3D space (y1,  y2,and  y3)  given  a  10-dimensional  feature  vector.
  The  features  are  readings  from  10  sensors  inthe experiment environment.  It is experimentally seen that the position of the particle dependslinearly on these readings.
  Can you figure out the relationship? Implement a linear regression with 3 targets.
* Q3Generalised Regression with non-polynomial kernel - The probability of rain on a particularday depends non-linearly on 5 satellite readings.
  You need to figure out the generalised regressionfunction that predicts the probability of rain given these features. Implement a generalised regression with a non-polynomial kernel with 1 target.

  Need to generate a correlation plot for each regression task.  Metrics - Pearson Correlation, mean squared error, meanabsolute error.
